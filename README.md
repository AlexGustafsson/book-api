      // The amount of the currency
      value: null,
      // The currency of the price
      currency: null
    };

    // The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) - always available
    this.isbn = null;

    // Cover image - always available
    this.cover = {

    this.description = null;

    // Category of the book - available after fetching

### Disclaimer

_Although the project is very capable, it is not built with production in mind. Therefore there might be complications when trying to use the API for large-scale projects meant for the public. The API was created to easily fetch information about books programmatically and as such it might not promote best practices nor be performant. This project is not in any way affiliated with Akademibokhandeln or Adlibris._
